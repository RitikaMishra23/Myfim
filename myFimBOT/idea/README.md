# Drishti - The Intelligent Eye

## What problem are we aiming to help solve?

In today's bustling environment, it's difficult for visually impaired people to travel around on their own, read text, understand their surroundings, and seek aid from others.

Due to a variety of socioeconomic and cultural biases, women have limited access to eye health care. Out of 1.1 billion visually impaired people globally of which 43 million are blind, 295 million people have moderate to severe vision impairment, 258 million people have mild vision impairment and 510 million people have near vision impairment, women constitutes 55% of the 1.1 billion visually impaired people. 89 percent of them live in low and middle-income households, with no access to treatment due to ignorance and bias, and the number is expected to triple by 2050.

Furthermore, 40% of people with visual impairment reported at least one head accident per year. Visual impairment affects 73% of people over the age of 50, and loneliness is more prevalent in women.

So, how can we help them and be there for them 24 hours a day, seven days a week so they can feel safe and content?

### Theme: Invent Tech-based solutions for Women Empowerment in India
Our project covers:
1. Create solutions for women health, safety and upliftment of vulnerable section.
2. Build solutions to enable economic freedom for women.
3. Shape the idea that you believe in and make a difference.


## Our Motivation

Meet Kavita Bisht, who was blinded as a result of a brutal acid attack. She used her difficulties to learn how to live her life with a positive attitude. She has so far empowered over 80 differently abled children in Uttarakhand.

There are hundreds of women like Kavita who want to achieve great heights in their lives despite the numerous obstacles they face, but may have accepted that they are handicapped due to a lack of emotional or physical support.

This is the problem that all visually impaired people face, regardless of gender.

With our Nobel idea, our team hopes to bring light into the lives of such people. We wish to create an extremely intelligent assistant that can assist visually impaired people with many aspects of everyday life, allowing them to focus more on their goals and achieve tremendous achievement.

## How did we plan?

To take our notion even further, after some primary research, we segregated all of the primary issues that visually impaired people confront.

- Information Access
- Stigma in Society
- Frequently living alone
- Difficulty getting around
- Concerns about safety
- Discrimination

These problem categories indicate not only physical issues, but also a lack of emotional support. We are attempting to assist in the resolution of as many categories as feasible.

We chose to expand our capabilities by stepping into the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and solving as many problems as possible using existing tools and technologies. Access to information, navigation, safety, and a reduction in loneliness are all problems that AI may help with.

## Proposed Solution

We propose a voice assistant designed specifically to assist the visually impaired. Using various custom layouts and speech synthesis, this system assists visually impaired people in accessing the most important resources that improve their living conditions.

The system carries out tasks based on the user's input (in the form of speech) and responds in the same manner.

### Hardware implementation

Lightweight smart glasses with a camera for capturing pictures, headphones, a USB port for charging, and WiFi or 4G for internet access. Computations will be handled by a microprocessor.

## Key features

## Novelty of the project

According to market research, similar products exist, but none of them are extensively used in the Indian community because they are expensive and their target audience does not speak Indian dialects.

For example:

1. _vOICe_ - Expensive and not customized for Indian Market
2. _IrisVision_ - Cannot tell about the surroundings, time or brightness outside
3. _eSight_ - Battery operated - nedes to keep track of charging from battery, restricts movement
4. _Jordy_ - Battery operated
5. _MyEye2_ - Cannot tell about the surroundings

So, _**Drishti**_ comes into effect as a one-stop solution because it includes all essential functionalities required by visually impaired people.

## Future scope of the project

1. Make it monitor what is going on in real time.
2. Recognising and remembering faces
3. Can interact with the user
4. Include all of India's major regional languages.
5. Find the desired objects within its frame.
6. The device should be usable even when not connected to the internet.
